									<h1>Backround
									</h1>
									<p>As a recent Mechanical Engineering graduate from Umass Dartmouth with research experience im exited to explore new career paths and apply my skills in mechanical design and R&D.</p>

								<p> I started my engineering journey in highschool where I enrolled in several engineering classes. During this time I got my first exposure to CAD, using inventor. Using this program we designed automotons and built them using a variety of tools such as saws and laser cutters. During college I drastically reshaped my work ethic incorporating far more studying, collaborative group work and time management. I began to learn the importance of working with a team to help learn new material, doing group study sessions before every exam and collaborating on homework assignments. During projects my ability to work with a team to tackle problems was drastically improved. I began research on superhydrophobic surfaces at the end of my junior year with Dr. Ling. Over the summer I worked to devlop a micro-channel for measuring pressure drop across a superhydrophobic surface, receiving an OUR undergraduate research grant. Later on I transitioned to researching bubble formation on SHS and surface wettability, presenting my findings at the MassURC conference. During my senior year I was selected to work on the Checkers Robot Team as the sole mechanical engineer. This was a daunting task at first as I would be responsible for designing the entire arm on SolidWorks by myself. However, I was able to overcome these challenges through dedication and good time management, steadily made progress throughout both semesters. By the time of the capstone presentation we had managed to create a fully functional checkers robot arm. I am extremely grateful for the team I was given for this project. Everyone was supportive of eachother, giving constructive criticism and absolutely dedicated to the projects success. I am also thankful for the professors and technicians at the university for guiding me in the process of becoming a professional engineer.</p>
